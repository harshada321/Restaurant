                                        <p>Indian manchow is a brown colored spicy soup in a soy base and has
                                                vegetables, fried noodles, and meat. It has no relation to the original
                                                Chinese soup or the province of Manchuria.

                                        <p>Believe it or not, noodles is a popular street food item in China, and they
                                                don't always have it as the main dish. When they have it on their main
                                                menu, it is eaten in a bowl with a thick paste or broth to add flavour.
                                                It does not resemble the stir-fried noodles variety mixed with
                                                vegetables, meat, egg and spicy sauce we get in India.

                                                Dimsums are served in classy Chinese restaurants in India as a dish
                                                while momos are found in every other place. However, both these are not
                                                part of the main dish in China, but a tea-time snack and fillings range
                                                from sweet to savoury. The dish is steamed in a bamboo basket, and the
                                                intricate folds of the pouch show the skill of the chef. <button
