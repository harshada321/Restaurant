      <p style="color:grey;font-size:small;">‘Restaurantly’ Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space in Toronto’s stylish Yorkville locale, ‘Restaurantly’ ‘s development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food.
<br><br>
In contrast to other Indian eateries, ‘Restaurantly’ was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.
<br><br>
We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.

Our menu highlights things that utilization the sound and fragrant flavors, however, forgets the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream.
